QBHLE High-Level Emulator runs QBasic 1.1 like console emulators run classic games: High-level emulation means improving the quality or convenience of the program while avoiding overhead &amp; complexity of emulating low-level operations. The goal is to eventually implement QuickBASIC 4.5 features applicable to running late 90s QBASIC community games.
